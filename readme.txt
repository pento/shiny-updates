A smoother experience for managing plugins and themes.

== Description ==

Shiny Updates is a WordPress Core Feature Plugin.

It replaces *The Bleak Screen of Sadness™* (example) with a simpler and more straight forward experience when installing, updating, and deleting plugins and themes.
Progress updates for these actions don't add a benefit, they are disruptive and confusing. Shiny Updates deals with these details behind the scenes, leaving users with clear actions and results.

Additionally, Shiny Updates adds a settings interface to activate automatic updates for major WordPress releases, plugins, and themes. It can be found in Dashboard -> Updates, together with all other updating tools.

Development for this plugin takes place at GitHub.
To report bugs or feature requests, please use [Github issues](https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues).

== Installation ==

1. Download Shiny Updates.
1. Unzip the folder into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin from Plugins -> Add New in your WordPress admin.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

== Screenshots ==
